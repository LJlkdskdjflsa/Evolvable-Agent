# Evolvable-Agent

## An Open-Source Framework for Self-Improving AI Systems

Evolvable-Agent is a pioneering open-source framework designed to create AI systems that can autonomously improve themselves through continuous evaluation and refinement. Inspired by neural network architectures and evolutionary algorithms, this project aims to develop agents that can scale in capability without hitting the ceiling of human oversight.

## Vision

We envision a future where AI systems can:
- Autonomously evaluate their own performance
- Identify areas for improvement
- Implement changes to their own prompts and tool usage
- Test and validate improvements
- Scale beyond human capabilities while remaining aligned with human values

## Core Architecture

The Evolvable-Agent framework consists of several specialized agents working together:

1. **Target Agent**: The primary agent whose capabilities we want to improve
2. **Monitor Agent**: Oversees the improvement process and orchestrates interactions
3. **Performance Review Agent**: Evaluates outputs against defined metrics
4. **Advisor Agent**: Generates specific improvement recommendations
5. **Improver Agent**: Implements changes to the Target Agent's prompts and configurations

## How It Works

1. The Target Agent produces outputs based on user inputs
2. The Monitor Agent triggers an evaluation cycle
3. The Performance Review Agent scores the output quality
4. The Advisor Agent provides specific improvement suggestions
5. The Improver Agent modifies the Target Agent's prompt or configuration
6. The new version is tested against benchmarks
7. If performance improves, the changes are adopted

## Features

- [ ] AI auto improve prompt of agent
- [ ] AI auto add Node to agent
- [ ] AI auto iterate tool use (MCP) of agent
...

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product
- Basic framework implementation with fixed agents
- Simple prompt optimization capabilities
- Web UI for input/output interaction
- Basic metrics for performance evaluation
- Demo with simple task domains

### Phase 2: Configurable Infrastructure
- Modular agent architecture
- Pluggable tools and capabilities
- Custom evaluation metrics
- Configurable optimization strategies
- Enhanced monitoring and logging
- Support for complex multi-step tasks

### Phase 3: Agent Neural Network
- Meta-learning capabilities
- Dynamic agent creation and specialization
- Self-directed exploration of solution spaces
- Collective agent intelligence
- Distributed improvement processes
- Robust safety and alignment mechanisms

## Key Differentiators

- **Self-Improvement**: Unlike traditional AI systems that require human fine-tuning, Evolvable-Agent continuously improves itself
- **Scalability**: The modular architecture allows for adding new tools and capabilities without rebuilding the system
- **Transparency**: All improvements are tracked, evaluated, and can be reviewed by humans
- **Configurability**: Every aspect of the system can be customized for specific domains
